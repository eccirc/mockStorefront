## About

The aim of this project was to learn the basics of Typescript and state management in React using MobX. I wanted to build an app of medium complexity which utilizes a mock API to call on for fetching data, and using a shopping/ store paradigm seemed like a great way to do this. I also had some fun designing and making logos for this dummy company.

**To Do**

-   Checkout form and validation

## Technologies

**HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Javascript**, **React**, **MobX**
